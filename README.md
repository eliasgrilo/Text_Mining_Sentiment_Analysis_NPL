1. Basic concepts of text mining:

 • Text extraction techniques.
 • Use of Tidytext.
 • Bag of words.
 • Important concepts: stop words, stemming, etc.
 • N-grams.
 • Topic modeling.
 
2. TF-IDF and Sentiment Analysis:

 • With or without stop words, some words are more common – this is not always the best approach.
 • Bag of words selects the most common word in the word count.
 • This can cause us to lose relevant information.
